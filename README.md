Car Price Prediction Dashboard
Overview:
The Car Price Prediction Dashboard is a data-driven project that aims to assist users in predicting and understanding the expected prices of cars based on various features. This project integrates data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques to provide insights into the factors influencing car prices.

Features:
Data Exploration: Explore a comprehensive dataset containing information about different car models, their specifications, and market prices.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

Machine Learning Model: Develop a robust machine learning model that predicts car prices based on selected features. The model is trained on historical data and can make predictions for new input data.

Interactive Dashboard: Utilize Power BI to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard. Visualizations include scatter plots, trend lines, and other insights to help users understand the relationships between car features and prices.

Prediction Functionality: Integrate the machine learning model into the dashboard to enable users to input car specifications and receive real-time price predictions.

Feature Importance Analysis: Showcase the importance of different features in influencing car prices through visualizations and insights.

Technologies Used:
Power BI for dashboard creation and visualization.
Python for data preprocessing and machine learning model development.
Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation and machine learning.
GitHub for version control and collaboration.
